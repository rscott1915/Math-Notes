# Math-Notes-and-Other-Stuff
Various notes I've written over the years, plus some other stuff I find interesting. Random compilation of things. Slowly writing up a bunch of old notes related to finance, stats, math, physics, etc. and uploading them here. The other repository is for code. This one is for ideas. 

Ver 1.0

Many notes on personal projects, foundations of math, stats, projects I've worked on. Lots of outstanding notes still to write up in overleaf. Here are some that I have done but need to put into LaTeX:

Things to (write up and) upload:
- Lecture notes on logical encoding in physical systems
- Lecture notes on irreducible representations as foundations for logical encodings and possibility for computing
- Notes on the Ito Calculus and Black-Scholes pricing
- Notes on PCA and portfolio optimization
