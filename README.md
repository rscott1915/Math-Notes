# Math-Notes-and-Other-Stuff
Various notes I've written over the years, plus some other stuff I find interesting. Random compilation of things. Slowly writing up a bunch of old notes related to finance, stats, math, physics, etc. and uploading them here. The other repository is for code. This one is for ideas.
